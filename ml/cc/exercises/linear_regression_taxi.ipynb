        "\n",
        "The model you trained with the feature ``TOTAL_MILES`` demonstrates fairly strong predictive power, but is it possible to do better? In this step, try training the model with two features, ``TRIP_MILES`` and ``TRIP_MINUTES``, to see if you can improve the model. You may recall that the original dataset does not include a feature ``TRIP_MINUTES``, but this feature can be easily derived from ``TRIP_SECONDS`` as shown in the code below.*\n",
        "\n",
        "**Instructions**\n",
        "1. Review the code in **Experiment 3** code cell.\n",
        "1. Run the **Experiment 3** code cell.\n",
        "1. Review the output from the training run and answer these questions:\n",
        "  * Does the model with two features produce better results than one using a single feature?\n",
        "  * Does it make a difference if you use ``TRIP_SECONDS`` instead of ``TRIP_MINUTES``?\n",
        "  * How well do you think the model comes to the ground truth fare calculation for Chicago Taxi Trips?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Notice that the scatter plot of the features vs. the label is a three dimensional (3-D) plot. This representation allows you to visualize both features and the label all together. The two features (TRIP_MILES and TRIP_MINUTES) are on the x and y axis, and the label (FARE) is on the z axis. The plot shows individual examples in the dataset as circles, and the model as a surface (plane). With this 3-D model, if the trained model is good you would expect most of the examples to land on the plane surface. The 3-D plot is interactive so you can explore the data further by clicking or dragging the plot.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer\n",
        "1. To answer this question for your specific training runs, compare the RMSE for\n",
        "each model. For example, if the RMSE for the model trained with one feature was\n",
        "3.7457 and the RMSE for the model with two features is 3.4787, that means that\n",
        "on average the model with two features makes predictions that are about $0.27\n",
        "closer to the observed fare.\n",
        "2. When training a model with more than one feature, it is important that all\n",
        "numeric values are roughly on the same scale. In this case, TRIP_SECONDS and\n",
        "TRIP_MILES do not meet this criteria. The mean value for TRIP_MILES is 8.3 and\n",
        "the mean for TRIP_SECONDS is 1,320; that is two orders of magnitude difference.\n",
        "In contrast, the mean for TRIP_MINUTES is 22, which is more similar to the scale\n",
        "of TRIP_MILES (8.3) than TRIP_SECONDS (1,320). Of course, this is not the\n",
        "only way to scale values before training, but you will learn about that in\n",
        "another module.\n",
        "3. I think it does pretty well\n",
